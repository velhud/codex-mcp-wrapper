# Testing

The test strategy separates four things:

- static/unit checks that do not require Codex login;
- live local MCP probing without ChatGPT or a public tunnel;
- real Codex CLI execution through PatchBay;
- release evals that still need real ChatGPT Developer Mode coverage. Direct tokenized public-tunnel MCP simulation is tracked separately from ChatGPT UI/tool-selection proof.

For the detailed release matrix, see [docs/testing/evals.md](docs/testing/evals.md).

## Baseline

Model-routing changes must cover the live-catalog menu, all seven documented worker families, `none`/`max`/`ultra` reasoning validation, initialize instructions, and public tool schemas. Tests should not require a newly announced model to be present in the maintainer's local Codex catalog during a staged rollout.

Install runtime and test dependencies before running the suite:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -e ".[test]"
```

```bash
codex --version

```

The opt-in Desktop task bridge has focused coverage for alias/configuration
privacy, durable receipt restart/recovery, idempotency, per-alias prompt
limits, startup failure handshakes, semantic completion
after a nonzero wrapper exit, writer/archive failure classification, the
official app-server archive/unarchive/read handoff sequence, and the public
tool surface:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python -m pytest -q tests/test_desktop_tasks.py tests/test_tool_surface.py tests/test_job_executor_command.py
```

Current verified Codex CLI baseline:

```text
codex-cli 0.153.4
```

The unit suite verifies:

- advertised public tool names and compatibility aliases;
- rejection of hidden/internal tools;
- read/write/open-world metadata;
- public schema validation and argument translation;
- connector doctor and auth policy behavior;
- MCP request body size limits;
- durable redacted job metadata persistence;
- current Codex JSONL `agent_message` result parsing;
- exact-session `task_complete` recovery when the CLI wrapper remains alive, including partial JSONL writes, session isolation, restart recovery, process-identity checks, and cancellation races;
- redacted/capped job stdout/stderr artifacts;
- optional private runtime evidence for full job briefs and MCP request/response transcripts while keeping durable state JSON prompt-body-free;
- strict completed-apply-job diff retrieval;
- `codex review` prompt stdin transport and config override allowlisting;
- metadata-only session listing;
- metadata-only Codex session discovery, PatchBay/Codex-home session dedupe, and gated bounded redacted transcript reads;
- process cancellation for running jobs;
- durable named worker start/message/list/inspect/stop behavior;
- worker artifact inbox import/list/inspect, repeated imports, structural archive rejection, sensitive-looking artifact filenames, and worker attachment;
- worker model/reasoning option discovery, sanitized model catalog output, and inherited worker execution settings;
- isolated worker worktree creation, same-worktree resume, change/file/diff views, workspace-scoped worker names, and explicit cleanup;
- multi-worker context relay through `context_from_workers` and `context_detail`;
- worker integration preview, dirty-base refusal, accepted dirty-base patterns, copied untracked-base context exclusion, modified copied-context refusal, blocked-path refusal, artifact-context exclusion, conflict reporting, and explicit accepted-result application;
- worker tool descriptors, worker-only mode, initialize instructions, ChatGPT-facing manager-loop guidance, direct-tool exception wording, full-access workbench authority wording, multi-worker encouragement, all-repo worker status/list/wait behavior when unscoped, default current-run scoping, same-conversation/history scopes, hidden-history counts, hashed ChatGPT session/work-run coordination metadata, compact team status, activity deltas since last status check, status polling guidance, status soft-cooldown responses, `codex_worker_wait` minimum-cadence enforcement, paged base and worker file inspection, durable evidence location labels, ownership-scope wording, live Codex session/heartbeat diagnostics, Codex auth/session-start serialization including configured `CODEX_HOME` and host file locking, redacted Codex startup failure diagnostics, recovered-running restart behavior, liveness/checkpoint views, terminal command cleanup, fallback result persistence, configurable liveness display thresholds, broader Codex agent-message event parsing, and partial report preservation after cancellation;
- Pro Request store behavior, sanitized mirrors, ownership/takeover, CLI create/list/show/response/dispatch/close, MCP list/read/claim/respond/dispatch/close descriptors, and blocked/busy/new-worker dispatch behavior;
- durable real MCP worker trial evidence writer, sanitizer, and negative cases;
- optional direct workspace write/edit and command power tools;
- runtime descriptor truthfulness for disabled direct write, bash, and transcript-read profiles;
- launcher profile storage and runtime config generation;
- installable CLI dispatch, noninteractive setup behavior, settings profile management, stdio transport, and tunnel binary resolution;
- fake public tunnel process supervision;
- default card-free ChatGPT Apps behavior, including no advertised output templates/resources unless `app.tool_cards: true`, plus opt-in tool-card resource discovery and widget hydration from both direct `window.openai.toolOutput` and standard `ui/notifications/tool-result` payloads;
- operator boundary and runtime-profile checks;
- path validation and symlink escape rejection;
- redaction helpers;
- MCP initialize instructions, including manager-first worker delegation guidance, direct read/search exception rules, and multi-worker team guidance.

## Connector Doctor

```bash
patchbay doctor
patchbay doctor --json
patchbay start --root /absolute/path/to/allowed/repo --tool-mode worker --print-only
patchbay start --root /absolute/path/to/allowed/repo --tool-mode worker --print-only --json
patchbay stdio --config config.yaml
```

On macOS, an optional user LaunchAgent can keep the local listener available
across login and unexpected process exits. Validate the installed service
without printing its private config or tunnel URL:

```bash
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.patchbay.local"
curl --fail --silent --show-error http://127.0.0.1:8000/status >/dev/null
```

For a restart check, record the listener PID from local process inspection,
send that process `SIGKILL`, and verify that a new listener becomes healthy.
Use the existing MCP self-test and a read-only status request for a completed
receipt to confirm that durable state remains available. Do not dispatch a new
worker merely to test service restart. The public tunnel is an independent
process and should return a non-502 response once the local listener is ready.

Expected output includes readiness checks, the local MCP URL, a redacted ChatGPT Server URL preview when token auth is enabled, a ChatGPT setup guide, and no raw token value. JSON output should include `setup_guide` with `chatgpt_steps`, `operator_commands`, `controls`, `warnings`, and profile metadata.

For public ChatGPT tunnel previews, set `PATCHBAY_HTTP_TOKEN` before using `--public-base-url`; the launcher should fail closed without that token.

## Live Local MCP Eval

Run a real launcher/server/probe cycle without ChatGPT and without a public tunnel:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/live_mcp_eval.py --json
```

The eval creates a temporary git repo with `AGENTS.md`, source files, `.env`, a symlink escape, and a repo-local `SKILL.md`; starts the compatibility launcher path `scripts/start.py`; then probes:

- MCP health and initialize;
- `tools/list`;
- precise compatibility alias descriptors;
- Apps resources;
- workspace open;
- skill list/load;
- file read and alias read;
- git status;
- workspace snapshot;
- show changes alias, including a path-scoped tracked-file diff;
- blocked `.env` read;
- blocked symlink read;
- enabled direct write and command execution in the full-power profile;
- `codex_self_test`.
- Pro Request CLI create plus MCP list/read/claim/respond and blocked dispatch when no origin worker exists.

This test proves the local MCP surface behaves like a compact ChatGPT-style client, but it does not prove ChatGPT Developer Mode itself.

## Direct Tokenized Public Tunnel Probe

For connector and tunnel changes, run a disposable public-tunnel probe before attempting real ChatGPT UI validation. Earlier validation has verified this through ngrok with a generated disposable token: missing token startup failed closed, Bearer-auth health passed, query-token MCP `initialize` passed, worker-mode `tools/list` exposed worker tools while hiding low-level job status tools, and an Apps-style file parameter drove `codex_worker_inbox` import/list/inspect, repeated import, `file://` rejection, isolated worker artifact attachment/read, artifact-context exclusion from integration, clean base checkout preservation, and worker cleanup. Re-run the tunnel probe with a configured hostname before treating it as current release evidence.

This proves public network reachability and token enforcement at the MCP level. It does not prove ChatGPT Developer Mode setup, tool selection, or ChatGPT-originated worker flows.

The consolidated external validation harness also covers this gate:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/external_chatgpt_style_validation.py --skip-heavy-codex --json
```

If `ngrok config check` passes but no `PATCHBAY_VALIDATION_NGROK_HOSTNAME` or `--ngrok-hostname` is provided, the public tunnel scenario is recorded as an external setup blocker rather than a PatchBay failure.

## External ChatGPT-Style Validation

Run the consolidated direct-MCP simulation when changing ChatGPT-facing connector behavior, worker lifecycle behavior, artifact import, session discovery, public schemas, or low-level Codex job/resume flows:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/external_chatgpt_style_validation.py --json
```

For a faster local surface pass without real Codex workers:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/external_chatgpt_style_validation.py --skip-heavy-codex --json
```

For terminal-state changes, exercise the public MCP worker lifecycle with a
disposable Codex fixture that records `task_complete` and deliberately leaves
its CLI wrapper alive:

```bash
python scripts/live_mcp_eval.py --json --exercise-terminal-reconciliation
```

The harness writes `calls.jsonl`, `results.json`, and `summary.md` under `.local/validation/external_chatgpt_style/<timestamp>/`. It starts PatchBay through the compatibility launcher path `scripts/start.py`, uses disposable repositories, creates separate MCP clients to simulate separate ChatGPT conversations, records `codex --version`, and redacts temporary paths and token-like values in evidence. The active internal ChatGPT Pro to private VM worker loop is working reliably for current self-use, but formal ChatGPT Developer Mode UI validation remains a separate manual gate, especially for multiple independent browser conversations sharing one Server URL.

For worker lifecycle regressions, add focused tests proving a durable `running` job is not marked stale while an executor-owned asyncio task, tracked subprocess, live process pid, or recent heartbeat still indicates life; proving worker start/message code schedules jobs through `JobExecutor.schedule_job` instead of orphaned background tasks; proving running workers expose compact `codex_worker_status` lines, activity deltas, liveness/checkpoints, and latest partial notes to ChatGPT; proving rapid repeated status calls return a soft cooldown instead of resetting deltas; proving `codex_worker_wait` returns a fresh status after a bounded wait; proving liveness thresholds are configurable display policy rather than task limits; proving terminal jobs clear live-only command state; proving Codex `agent_message` content variants parse into reports/checkpoints; proving exact-session `task_complete` finalizes a worker even when the wrapper lingers; proving prior-turn and unrelated-session terminal events are ignored; proving restart recovery validates process identity before cleanup; proving completion/cancellation races are first-terminal-decision wins; proving fallback results are persisted when the final structured result is missing; and proving cancellation preserves captured partial reports/checkpoints.

## Real Codex CLI Through MCP

For execution changes, run a disposable real-Codex plan job through MCP. The expected path is:

1. start `patchbay start` or `scripts/start.py` against a disposable git repo;
2. initialize MCP;
3. call `codex_plan_job`;
4. poll `codex_get_status`;
5. call `codex_get_result`;
6. confirm a clean structured summary and `session_ref` when Codex returns one.

Current final validation recorded Codex CLI `0.153.4` and confirmed PatchBay parses the current JSONL `item.completed` / `agent_message` result shape. Older external validation notes may retain `0.144.1` as historical evidence. Worker verification should always record the current local `codex --version`.

## Real Codex Worker Continuity

For read-only worker continuity, run:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/worker_phase1_eval.py --timeout 600
```

Expected result:

1. start one named read-only worker;
2. complete its first Codex turn;
3. capture a Codex session internally;
4. reconstruct runtime objects to simulate PatchBay restart;
5. list the worker by name;
6. continue the same Codex session by worker name;
7. avoid exposing backend job/session ids or private paths in public worker output.

## Real Codex Isolated Writing Worker

For Phase 2 worker changes, run:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/worker_phase2_eval.py --timeout 900
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/worker_phase3_eval.py --timeout 900
```

Expected result:

1. start one named worker in default `isolated_write` mode;
2. create one external worker worktree;
3. write only inside that worktree;
4. keep the base checkout clean;
5. reconstruct runtime objects to simulate PatchBay restart;
6. continue the same Codex session by worker name;
7. reuse the same worker worktree;
8. expose changed files and one-file diff only when requested;
9. explicitly discard the worker workspace on cleanup.



For Phase 3 worker coordination, run:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/worker_phase3_eval.py --timeout 900
```

The Phase 3 eval should:

1. start one isolated writing implementer;
2. inspect its changed files;
3. start one read-only reviewer with `context_from_workers` and `context_detail="diff"`;
4. verify the reviewer receives bounded diff context without private paths;
5. send the reviewer report back to the implementer with `context_detail="report"`;
6. verify the implementer keeps the same session and worktree;
7. verify `codex_worker_status`, `codex_worker_wait`, and `codex_worker_list` return useful compact team status / `team_report`, including all-repo unscoped visibility, default `scope=current` behavior, `scope=conversation` and `scope=history` escape hatches, hidden-history counts, minimum-cadence wait behavior, and soft cooldown fields for rapid polling;
8. keep the base checkout clean.

## Manual Curl Smoke

## Direct MCP Worker Trial

After applying worker integration changes, run a direct MCP worker trial before claiming the worker bridge is ready for normal use.

Run the durable direct-MCP worker trial when validating real MCP worker lifecycle evidence:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/real_mcp_worker_trial.py
```

This writes progressive `calls.jsonl`, `results.json`, and `summary.md` artifacts under `.local/validation/real_mcp_trial/<timestamp>/`. It uses a disposable repo, a trial-specific runtime config, `worker` tool mode by default, and proves worker integration does not create a commit by comparing commit counts before and after `codex_worker_integrate`. The trial config runs worker Codex subprocesses with `--ignore-user-config`; Codex authentication still uses `CODEX_HOME`, but unrelated user-level MCP connector config is not loaded into validation workers.

Run the negative-case variant to cover refusal and leak checks over the same real MCP path:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/real_mcp_worker_trial.py --include-safety-cases
```

The `--include-safety-cases` flag name is historical. It adds active-worker integration refusal, read-only worker integration refusal, dirty-base refusal, blocked `.env` refusal, untracked binary refusal, conflict preview refusal, cleanup isolation, connector/OAuth stderr noise scanning, and artifact leak scanning.

Run the multi-client variant to cover one shared MCP server URL with two logical MCP sessions:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/real_mcp_worker_trial.py --multi-client --tool-mode worker --json
```

For a fuller local release gate, combine the multi-client and safety paths:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/real_mcp_worker_trial.py --multi-client --include-safety-cases --tool-mode worker --json
```

The multi-client variant verifies session-local tool modes, safe shared inspection, cross-owner mutation refusal, explicit takeover, ownership transfer, preview-before-integrate, no automatic commit, connector/OAuth stderr noise scanning, and sanitized private evidence under `.local/validation/real_mcp_trial/<timestamp>/`. With `--include-safety-cases`, it also verifies active-worker, read-only-worker, dirty-base, blocked `.env`, untracked binary, conflict-preview, and isolated-cleanup refusal paths. Unit coverage also verifies that new worker/job/artifact owner metadata stores owner scope and schema, and that old unscoped records report `legacy_connection` until explicit takeover migrates them to the current scoped owner model.

For worker cancellation changes, also run a focused disposable live probe that starts a worker, calls `codex_worker_stop` without `force`, verifies `stop_confirmation_required: true`, then repeats with `force: true` to clean the worker.

Start the server:

```bash
patchbay start --root /absolute/path/to/allowed/repo
```

Health:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Initialize:

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-11-25","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"1.0"}}}'
```

Save the returned `Mcp-Session-Id` header and use it for `tools/list`, `resources/list`, and `tools/call`.

For Hub compatibility and Hub V2 control-plane changes, run both fleet
evaluators:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/live_hub_edge_eval.py --json
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/live_hub_v2_eval.py --json
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/production_entrypoint_restart_eval.py --json --rehearse-old-schema
```

The V2 evaluator crosses a real loopback TCP boundary for both MCP manager
clients and two production-shaped Edge runners. It proves the exact 31-tool
catalog, identifier-rich startup fallbacks, independent manager groups,
workspace projection, group preflight and machine pinning, truthful aggregate
batch status, parallel child starts, same-worker follow-up, inspection, stale
integration-preview replacement, signed integration without commit, durable
result recovery, group closure, and Hub/Edge restart persistence. It must also prove the manager
completion contract outside-in: an `end_to_end` group reports
`final_response_allowed=false` while preflight, worker work, integration, or
closure remains, and reports `final_response_allowed=true` only after terminal
closure.

`production_entrypoint_restart_eval.py` uses the installed production command
paths (`patchbay hub start`, Hub enrollment, Edge enrollment, and the real
long-running `patchbay edge start`) rather than constructing internal adapters
by hand. It persists a real group, preflight, completed worker session,
receipts, Hub identity, Edge generation, and projections; stops and restarts
both services with the same absolute configuration and state paths; then sends
a natural-language follow-up to the same worker session. It also enables the
production continuity guards and proves missing Hub or Edge state fails closed.
With `--rehearse-old-schema`, it builds separate real schema-2 Hub and Edge
fixtures, proves both unmarked production startups fail closed, prepares the
exact sources with `patchbay hub backup create --prepare-migration` and
`patchbay edge backup create --prepare-migration`, migrates and restarts both
through production CLIs, proves durable identities/data survive with monotonic
runtime revisions, and restores both immutable bundles to fresh paths. The
upgrade proof does not construct internal runtime adapters.

The final Hub release gate is the outside-in public connector scenario in
[`docs/testing/public-hub-acceptance.md`](docs/testing/public-hub-acceptance.md).
It must use the real authenticated public MCP URL, a fresh client that sees only
the server's returned instructions and 31 tools, a disposable Edge repository,
real Codex workers, same-worker follow-up, signed integration, base verification,
cleanup, group closure, and a reconnect check. Calling representative tools
once or testing an internal handler directly is not live acceptance.
The release evidence must also include one supplemental consequential flow
through the single `patchbay_worker_start` entry path, not only batch start.

Hub wait regression coverage must prove that an omitted `since_revision`
snapshots current worker state, ordinary Edge heartbeats/resource telemetry do
not wake the wait, and only worker projection changes or timeout complete it.
An omitted Hub worker `wait_seconds` must use the patient 30-second manager
default. Work-group status waits must honor `since_revision` and
`wait_for_change_seconds` instead of silently returning immediately.
Duplicate worker names must return a terminal pre-effect refusal with guidance
to use a unique name or `auto_suffix`, never `outcome_unknown`.

Hub V2 release tests must also cross the real production handler boundary. A
custom evaluator handler is not sufficient evidence for integration, cleanup,
or Pro Request behavior. Regression coverage must prove that:

- signed integration tokens and idempotency keys reach `WorkerRuntime` through
  `ToolHandler`;
- explicit isolated-worktree discard consent reaches worker cleanup;
- more than 100 historical dispatches or result receipts cannot starve new
  work or acknowledgement delivery;
- terminal dispatch history is not rewritten by ordinary status/dispatch
  passes, and one poisoned receipt or reconciliation record cannot starve later
  records;
- the production-shaped Hub evaluator uses a real loopback TCP MCP connection,
  exposes exactly 31 manager tools, and proves that a poisoned older receipt
  cannot block newer grouped-worker results;
- a result created under an older immutable attempt contract completes after a
  rolling Edge contract upgrade while the outer request authenticates with the
  current contract;
- an expired initial lease with explicit `effect_started=false` creates or
  reuses exactly one successor attempt instead of entering permanent
  reconciliation;
- every nonterminal public operation recovery action names the callable
  `patchbay_operation_status` tool rather than an internal transition;
- exact-session semantic completion is durable before wrapper cleanup returns,
  the complete process group is reaped, all post-completion process/pipe waits
  are bounded, same-worker message and integration are refused while cleanup is
  pending, and executor-task liveness is not mislabeled as a live Codex process;
- liveness refresh reuses conclusive durable terminal-cleanup proof instead of
  repeating process-tree discovery for every historical turn on each Edge
  projection cycle, while missing cleanup remains fail-closed and is
  periodically rechecked instead of being rediscovered on every heartbeat;
- production Edge HTTP transport reuses a bounded pool of persistent
  connections across independent control loops, discards broken connections,
  and never hides an uncertain response behind an automatic request retry;
- stable Edge state tokens suppress duplicate full-history projection builds
  and uploads, while heartbeat carries bounded counts rather than embedding the
  full worker snapshot and a changed job/liveness/Pro Request revision forces a
  new atomic projection;
- current-version durable job records load without being rewritten, while old
  records still receive one redacting/normalizing migration write;
- stable terminal isolated-worktree projections reuse their background change
  summary, a new worker turn or explicit force refresh invalidates that summary,
  fully terminal shared-checkout workers reuse one path-scoped background
  summary and base HEAD, active shared work scans each once per snapshot, and
  one malformed worker
  projection cannot suppress valid workers from the same fleet snapshot;
- missing worker projections retain group-scoped inspect/message routing through
  the durable fleet identity without cross-group or cross-generation leakage;
- serialized shared-write policy refuses competing base writers, while an
  architect-selected `manager_controlled` group accepts deliberate concurrent
  shared writers and exposes that policy;
- temporary artifact URLs are carried through transient dispatch state rather
  than retained as durable operation payloads;
- group close and reassignment account for every associated worker operation;
- all six Pro Request tools route to the owning Edge and expose only sanitized
  fleet projections at the Hub.

## Release Evals Still Required

Before public release, run all of these against disposable repos:

- formal real ChatGPT Developer Mode release-matrix coverage, including multiple independent browser conversations sharing one Server URL;
- ChatGPT-originated worker flow through a token-gated public tunnel if tunnel use is advertised in the real ChatGPT UI;
- direct workspace orientation from ChatGPT;
- real `codex_plan_job` from ChatGPT;
- real `codex_apply_job` from ChatGPT with diff inspection;
- real resume or interactive continuation from ChatGPT using `session_ref`;
- real named worker start/list/inspect/restart/message flow from ChatGPT;
- `.ai-bridge` handoff write, local dry-run, local execute, and status/diff readback;
- blocked path, blocked symlink, disabled power-tool, unsafe bash, and missing-token failures.

## Worker Integration Eval

Run after worker integration changes:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python scripts/worker_phase4_eval.py --timeout 900
```

This proves that a real isolated writing worker result can be previewed, explicitly applied to the base checkout, and preserved in the worker worktree without exposing private paths.
