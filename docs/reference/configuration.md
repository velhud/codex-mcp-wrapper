# Configuration Reference

This page holds the configuration and launch details that were intentionally moved out of the root README. The README should stay product-first; this page is the operator reference.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Git
- `codex` CLI on `PATH`
- Codex CLI login or API key configured for the local Codex CLI

Recommended Codex CLI baseline for the current branch:

```bash
codex --version
# codex-cli 0.153.4
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ".[test]"  # needed for local test runs
```

`requirements.txt` holds the minimal runtime dependency set. `pyproject.toml` holds package metadata, console entry points (`patchbay` and `patchbay-stdio`), and the `test` extra used by CI and local verification.

## Important defaults

Edit `config.yaml` or use `patchbay start --root ...` to generate a private runtime config.

# Optional private target fields in desktop-task-targets.json:

#   "allowed_permission_modes": ["workspace-write", "danger-full-access"]
#   "default_permission_mode": "workspace-write"
# app_server mode requires an absolute Unix socket for a supervised Codex
# app-server using the same Codex home/task store. `codex app-server
# --listen unix://` is the supported local setup. Do not point this at the
# Desktop app's Electron IPC socket. PatchBay does not discover sockets or use
# CLI archive/unarchive fallbacks, and a failed or interrupted handoff requires
# a new receipt after local recovery.

# In the private targets JSON, max_prompt_length defaults to 12000 Unicode
# characters and is capped at 16000. It is per alias; the public MCP schema
# advertises only the 16000-character hard cap.

# Sanitized Desktop reports are capped at 200,000 Unicode characters. Status
# returns at most 12,000 characters per report chunk; use report_offset and
# report_limit for later chunks after a completed receipt.

Blank logging paths resolve outside the checkout under `PATCHBAY_HOME/runtime` when `PATCHBAY_HOME` is set, otherwise under `~/.patchbay/runtime`. Set explicit paths only when you deliberately want repo-local or custom runtime state.

### Keeping a local macOS listener available

For a long-lived local connector, install the optional per-user LaunchAgent
after the private runtime config and Desktop target allowlist are ready:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/install_macos_launch_agent.py \
  --config /private/path/to/desktop-trial.yaml \
  --patchbay-home /private/path/to/patchbay-home \
  --log-dir /private/path/to/patchbay-home/runtime/logs/launchd \
  --python /private/path/to/venv/bin/python \
  --codex-bin /opt/homebrew/bin/codex
```

The installer writes a mode-0600 plist under the current user's
`~/Library/LaunchAgents`, uses `RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive`, and runs as the
logged-in user with a narrow executable path. It does not use `sudo`, create a
system daemon, alter the private config, or expose target IDs. Standard output
and error go to the supplied private log directory. Re-run the command after
changing the checkout, Python environment, or runtime config; it replaces only
the installer-owned label. `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.patchbay.local`
shows the loaded service.

The managed tunnel remains a separate process. Verify both the local listener
and the tunnel after installation, and treat a tunnel-side 502 as a transport
or local-listener readiness failure until the local service is healthy. A
Desktop task that owns the writer still requires the Desktop-native
archive/unarchive handoff before a new continuation; launchd cannot resolve
that ownership state.

`audit_file` is compact metadata. `job_logs_dir` stores bounded/redacted Codex
stdout, stderr, and result artifacts. `job_state_dir` stores durable job state
without prompt bodies. `private_evidence_dir` stores optional private evidence:
full job briefs and full MCP request/response transcripts. See
[`runtime-evidence.md`](runtime-evidence.md).

`process_capture_max_bytes` bounds each in-memory stdout/stderr tail used for
result extraction (default 4 MB, hard cap 64 MB). `process_event_line_max_bytes`
bounds one streamed Codex JSONL event (default 8 MB, hard cap 64 MB). A larger
line is fully drained and recorded as oversized rather than passed to the JSON
parser, so a verbose command cannot deadlock the worker pipe or grow PatchBay
memory without bound. These settings do not limit Codex work, repository files,
or the worker report schema.

For public/default use, leave `private_evidence_log`, `store_job_prompts`, and
`store_mcp_transcripts` false. For a trusted personal VM/workbench where
debuggability matters more than minimizing private local artifacts, set
`private_evidence_log: true`.

Hub commands select the complete V2 31-tool manager surface by default.
`hub.control_plane: v1` explicitly selects the legacy runtime; any other value
is rejected. Blank
`hub.state_db` resolves under `PATCHBAY_HOME/runtime/hub/`; `hub.state_file` is
the legacy V1 JSON store. Hub state is private runtime state for enrolled
machines, durable work groups, current group selections, command routing,
worker briefs needed for durable dispatch/replay, and compact event history. It
is not repository data and should not be committed. If Hub state is corrupt,
PatchBay quarantines it and returns a recovery error instead of silently
resetting fleet/group state.

After initial Hub creation, record the returned Hub id as `hub.expected_hub_id`
and set `hub.require_existing_state: true`. After initial Edge journal creation,
set `hub.edge.require_existing_journal: true` on that Edge. These deployment
continuity guards turn a missing path, wrong mount, or wrong state database into
a startup failure instead of an apparently healthy empty control plane.

`hub.recovery_dispatch_interval_seconds` (default `1.0`, bounded to
`0.1..60`) controls the Hub process's crash-recovery dispatch loop.
`hub.recovery_dispatch_batch_size` (default `100`, bounded to `1..1000`)
limits one recovery cycle. The loop reoffers only durable operations that are
still dispatchable. Normal read/status tools never sweep unrelated mutation
backlogs; a remote read may dispatch only the operation it created itself.
During an online Hub backup, the shared admission gate pauses new Edge claims
and mutation dispatch while result upload, reconciliation, and read/status
traffic remain available.

An initialized Hub database with an older supported schema cannot migrate merely
because a newer process opened it. Startup requires a validated pre-migration
backup marker bound to that exact source state. Create the offline first-upgrade
bundle with `patchbay hub backup create --prepare-migration`; the default marker
is private and adjacent to `hub.state_db`. Set
`hub.pre_migration_backup_marker` only when an operator deliberately stores the
marker elsewhere.

When PatchBay is run by a service manager such as systemd, set a real user home
for the service process. Codex workers inherit `CODEX_HOME` for Codex auth and
PatchBay also passes `HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` to
worker jobs so tools such as `gh` and `git` can find the same GitHub CLI and git
credential configuration that works in an interactive shell.

```env
HOME=/root
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/root/.config
GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/root/.gitconfig
CODEX_HOME=/root/.codex
```

## Authentication

For local loopback use, auth can remain off. For non-loopback bind addresses, public URL mode, tunnel mode, or explicit `PATCHBAY_HTTP_TOKEN`, every MCP/status request must include a matching Bearer token or an allowed query token.

Prefer Bearer auth where the client supports headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Copied ChatGPT Server URLs can use query-token auth:

```text
https://your-tunnel.example/mcp?patchbay_token=<token>
```

Never commit or share a real tokenized URL.

## Tool mode defaults

Use `--tool-mode worker` for the first ChatGPT validation run. It exposes the worker tools plus the read-only context tools needed to brief them, while hiding low-level job/session controls and aliases.

ChatGPT can inspect mode choices with `codex_tool_mode_info` and request a session-local mode change with `codex_tool_mode_switch`. The switch does not rewrite config files.

## Runtime state

PatchBay keeps local paths, raw session ids, worker worktree paths, process logs, and runtime files behind the local control boundary unless a specific public tool is designed to expose a bounded summary. Private evidence files can include full ChatGPT tool calls and full worker/Codex prompts when explicitly enabled; they are private runtime evidence, not repository data.
